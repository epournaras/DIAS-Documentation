Changing of possible states
***************************

Possible states are a list of all states possible for the device so select/send to this specific peer.
When a selected state is chosen, it has to be a state of the possible states.
In order to keep the selected stated rather close to the actual value, the possible can/need to be updated sometimes.

In order to do that, the device sends the DIAS node a PossibleStatesMessage.

The Node then sets the list of the newly received Possible states as its own.

**Note:** If the newly received possible states are the same as the old ones, nothing gets done.
