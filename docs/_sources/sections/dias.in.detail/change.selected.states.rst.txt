Changing of selected states
***************************

The selected state is a selected element of the elements in the possible states.

Upon receiving a new selected state through a SelectedStateMessage, the internal selected state gets changed.

**Note:** The selected state only gets changed, if the newly received one is a valid element of the internally stored possible states.
