DIAS - Dynamic Intelligent Aggregation Service
==============================================

Welcome to the DIAS documentation. DIAS provides real-time data analytics for the IoT, highly adaptive and truly decentralized.

If you follow the instructions below, you will be up and running in matter of minutes.

DIAS stands for Dynamic Intelligent Aggregation Service.

**Dynamic**

 - DIAS can operate in unreliable environments with rapidly changing input data

**Intelligent**

 - Thanks to an intelligent memory system that guarantees accurate measurements

**Aggregation**

 - Concerns the computation of several large-scale collective measurements

**Service**

 - DIAS can be used by different techno-socio-economic applications
