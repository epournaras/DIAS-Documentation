<h3>About this Tutorial<a class="headerlink" href="#about-this-tutorial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This user guide introduces you to the functionalities of Smart Agora and guides you on how you can easily create your own projects, experiments, and data collection. It guides you by listing the step-by-step procedure of crowdsourcing tasks in an automated way by the application, combined with extensive use of application screenshots, cross-references, and supplementary notes. All this is meant to give you a good understanding of the Smart Agora application and the crowd-sourcing dashboard in order to make use of it right away.</p>

<h3>Smart Agora<a class="headerlink" href="#smart-agora" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Smart Agora</strong> provides a data-collection approach for data scientists by active participation in smart cities in which the experiment participants collect data by using simple yet ethically sensitive technology. Data scientists can autonomously initiate collective movements about data collection in an urban environment. These collective movements can be easily orchestrated by defining augmented points of interest in public urban space. The participants of an experiment can explore with their smartphones and in a gamified way these points while they anonymously share informed opinions and highly relevant contextual (sensors) data.
Smart Agora platform consists of the following two core components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Crowd-sourcing Dashboard</li>
<li>Smart Phone Application</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-1-crowd-sourcing-dashboard">
<h2>Chapter 1 - Crowd-sourcing Dashboard<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-1-crowd-sourcing-dashboard" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Data scientists and experiment participants both can create user-centric interactions such as questionnaires or surveys using the crowd-sourcing participation dashboard. The participation dashboard requests data and opinions from experiment participants in the public space of interest by crowd-sourcing tasks. These tasks are deployed at different points of interest in the public space, transforming them into augmented reality and making a highly interactive experience. The data scientist can log on to the crowd-sourcing dashboard to perform their respective tasks.

<p>From the dashboard’s home screen, you can proceed to crowd-source task(s). You can create projects, tasks, and assignments using the dashboard’s main menu. It’s important to note the following description of projects, tasks, and assignments before creating crowdsourcing tasks.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Projects</strong>: A project is a single crowdsourcing job. Everything else you create goes under the scope of a project: data collection assets, assignments, tasks and experiment participants. A user (experiment participant) can be connected with the project using the Smart Agora App.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Tasks</strong>: A task is like data storage; it contains the data collected by the individual actions on a data collection asset. For example, data collected by the experiment participants will be stored in a task. A project can have one or more tasks. It’s required to create at least one task under a project for receiving data from experiment participants. These tasks allow the data scientist to store information in an organized manner on the server. For instance, if a data scientist wants to conduct an experiment at two different occasions e.g. evening or morning time, the data scientist can create two tasks for storing the data on different occasions.</div>
</div>
<p>The following diagram shows the relationship between assets, assignments, and tasks.</p>

</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Project:</strong> It contains a dropdown list of projects that you already have created from Project Configuration. Select a project from the <strong>Select Project</strong> dropdown list in order to create an asset for the project.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Mode:</strong> It contains a dropdown list of assignment modes (Simple, Sequence, Decision or DIAS Simple) required to create an asset. It provides the functionality to complete data collection asset for experiment participant in following four different settings.</div>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Sequence:</strong> You can create a data collection asset containing several survey questions. In sequence mode, these questions are created in ascending sequence order and experiment participants must have to follow the same sequence in order to answer all questions using the android app. For instance, if five questions are asked in a sequence, experiment participant will answer them in order (1st question, 2nd question, 3rd question and so on) before reaching the destination.</li>
<li><strong>Simple:</strong> In this case, questions are created without any sequence. Experiment participants can randomly visit and answer survey questions using the android app by visiting checkpoints on the map while walking on a street or traveling through the city.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> You can create a data collection asset with Decision mode for decision-based questions using crowd-sourcing dashboard. In this case, the next question will be asked to the experiment participant based on his answer to the previous question. For example, in a real-time scenario, if there is a question “Do you like Hbf?” for experiment participant and assume there two answers YES or NO, you may like to ask next question based on the previous answer e.g.” Take the train to airport.” or “Use bus to reach the airport”.</li>
<li><strong>DIAS Simple:</strong> It allows to create multiple Likert scale questions (with the scale values (1-10)) at any location called “group point” and experiment participants can answer questions using the android app by randomly visiting group points on the map. Android app will compute the average, of Likert scale answer(s) at each group point, and send it to Dynamic Intelligent Aggregation Service (DIAS), which returns the aggregated response of all users at the same location. For example, an experiment participant provides information of noise level at any location by answering some Likert scale questions, android app will show the aggregated response of other users on the screen who have visited the same group point. It will also show the average value of the current experiment participant on-screen for instant real-time comparison.</li>
</ol>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Click the Next button after providing the required information.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Default Credits</strong>: You can set default credit points for all questions as an incentive to motivate the involvement of experiment participants.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Start Address</strong>: You can provide a start location, from where experiment participants need to begin the experiment.</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Destination Address</strong>: Similarly, provide a destination location where the experiment is supposed to be finished.</div>

<h2>Chapter 2 - Smart Agora Android application<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-2-smart-agora-android-application" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Smart Agora Android Application fosters for data scientists a more informed data collection approach at relevant public spaces. By encouraging physical presence in an augmented and gamified way, experiment participants visit public spaces more evidently and can collect highly relevant data about their environment. The experiment participant moves in the urban environment via different transport means or on foot. Physical presence provides to experiment, participants, the opportunity to witness points of interest in which data collection is required. The physical space turns to an augmented and gamified landscape for data collection.</p>
