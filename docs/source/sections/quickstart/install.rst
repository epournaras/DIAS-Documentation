Installation + Setup 
********************

DIAS requires no further installation other than the required downloads (:ref:`label_quickstart_download`).

Deployments
-----------

DIAS comes with pre-configured deployments. As there are a number of components required to operate a DIAS network (e.g :ref:`label_protopeer_overview`), there are various configuration files for each component. For convenience, these are all grouped into components.

In the next section, when you launch DIAS (:ref:`label_launch`), you will need to choose a deployment.

To get started, you should choose deployments/localhost, but you may add or modify deployments.
