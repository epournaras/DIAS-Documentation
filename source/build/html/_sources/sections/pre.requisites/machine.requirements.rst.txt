Machine Requirements
********************

DIAS requires at least 128Mb of RAM per peer in the network. So for a network with 10 DIAS aggregation peers, that's about 1.2Gb. Usually we run networks of 20 to 200 peers on machines with 32Gb to 256 Gb of Ram.

A fairly decent CPU is expected. Good performance has been observed with the following CPUs on networks up to 40 peers:

- Intel Core i7 Quad-Core 2.3 GHz

- Intel Core i7-6700 Quad-Core Skylake
